When a leading multi-brand dealership started missing delivery commitments, it wasn’t because of poor technicians — it was visibility. Vehicles were ready but still waiting. Bays stayed full, and same-day deliveries kept slipping.

That changed when the team implemented **Platemate AI** and **AIDeal** together. What followed was a 10% increase in service capacity — without adding staff or a single extra bay.

## The Challenge: Bottlenecks Hidden in Plain Sight

The dealership aimed for a **24-hour turnaround** for all service jobs.  
But once the vehicle entered the workshop, visibility vanished.  
Cars were often completed but undelivered — waiting for billing, approval, or a cashier.  
No one knew exactly how long each vehicle had been on site.

The result:  
- Bays remained occupied by finished vehicles  
- New jobs piled up in the yard  
- Same-day turnarounds hovered between 40–60%

## The Solution: Automated Tracking and AI-Driven Reporting

Using existing CCTV cameras, **Platemate AI** began capturing every vehicle’s **entry and exit timestamps** automatically.  
No manual input, no extra devices — just real-time detection of number plates and movement.

Meanwhile, **AIDeal** analyzed this data, linking it with job status, service type, and completion reports.  
Managers started receiving **daily email alerts** listing vehicles still on the premises after 24 hours.

This simple change created complete operational observability — everyone knew what was pending, for how long, and why.

## The Results: Measurable, Immediate Impact

Within weeks, the dealership saw transformation across the workshop:

- **10% more service capacity** — same bays, faster rotation  
- **Same-day delivery rates up to 90%**  
- **Customer satisfaction scores improved** due to reliable delivery times  
- **Bottlenecks identified** in areas like billing and electrician availability  
- **Supervisors acted earlier**, before jobs piled up

The biggest surprise? No new investment in infrastructure. Just better use of what already existed.

## Insights from the Team

> “Once we started seeing the daily pending list, the whole team became more alert. The system didn’t blame anyone — it just showed the facts. That changed everything.”

> “We thought we needed more bays. Turns out, we just needed better visibility.”

## Key Takeaway

AI isn’t just about automation — it’s about awareness.  
When your system can see vehicles coming in and going out, it naturally helps people make better, faster decisions.  

With **Platemate AI** and **AIDeal**, visibility becomes the new productivity tool — giving dealerships an instant, data-driven path to improved turnaround, happier customers, and more business.
