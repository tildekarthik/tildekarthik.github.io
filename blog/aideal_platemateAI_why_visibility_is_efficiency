Every dealership wants faster turnaround — but not every dealership *knows* where the time goes.

In today’s service operations, efficiency isn’t just about tools or technicians. It’s about **visibility**.  
The moment you can *see* every vehicle’s journey from entry to exit, you start to notice the invisible losses — waiting, delays, and idle bays.

That’s why forward-thinking dealerships are now using **visibility** itself as the key performance metric.

## The Visibility Gap

Most workshops still rely on manual updates, whiteboards, or service advisors to track progress.  
But as vehicle volumes increase, so does complexity.  
A few untracked cars quickly snowball into hours of wasted bay time and missed same-day deliveries.

**Without visibility:**
- Completed cars sit idle, blocking new jobs  
- Managers react only after customer complaints  
- Data is scattered across CCTV, DMS, and manual notes  

**With visibility:**
- Every vehicle’s journey is timestamped and traceable  
- Supervisors can spot delays before they become bottlenecks  
- The entire workshop operates with live situational awareness  

That single change transforms day-to-day management.

## How 24-Hour Turnaround Became Achievable

When dealerships pair **Platemate AI** (for automatic in/out detection) with **AIDeal** (for analytics and reporting), the 24-hour turnaround target becomes tangible and trackable.

Every car that enters the gate is logged with:
- **Plate number**
- **Entry timestamp**
- **Exit timestamp (when it leaves the premises)**

**AIDeal** aggregates this data and highlights vehicles that cross the 24-hour mark.  
Supervisors get email alerts with clear, actionable information — no need to dig through logs or CCTV.

This visibility makes it possible to fix small delays before they snowball.

## The Psychological Advantage of Being Seen

There’s an often-overlooked benefit: **accountability through awareness**.  
When everyone in the team knows that turnaround times are tracked automatically, priorities align naturally.

Technicians close jobs faster.  
Cashiers stay alert to pending deliveries.  
Managers get ahead of potential bottlenecks — instead of reacting late.

It’s not about surveillance.  
It’s about *shared visibility* — everyone working with the same, live information.

## Results That Speak for Themselves

Dealerships using AI-driven visibility tools have seen:
- **Same-day deliveries rise from 40–60% to 70–90%**
- **10% increase in service capacity** without expanding bays
- **Higher CSI scores** due to timely handovers

When your data tells you exactly where the time goes, fixing it becomes effortless.

## The New Metric for Modern Dealerships

Turnaround time is no longer just a report — it’s a **live performance indicator**.  
And the foundation of that indicator is visibility.

With **Platemate AI** and **AIDeal**, dealerships can measure, monitor, and improve turnaround continuously — not once a month, but every single day.
