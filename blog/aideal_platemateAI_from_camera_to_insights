Most dealerships already have dozens of CCTV cameras quietly recording every moment — vehicles arriving, bays filling, customers waiting.  
What if those same cameras could tell you *why* a service bay is free, *which* vehicles are pending delivery, or *how long* a car has been waiting after completion?

That’s exactly what we set out to do with **Platemate AI** and **AIDeal** — turning ordinary cameras into a real-time source of operational intelligence.

## From Passive Footage to Actionable Data

Cameras are everywhere, but the data inside them is rarely used beyond security.  
**Platemate AI** changes that. It automatically detects license plates, timestamps each entry and exit, and matches that with images — all from your existing CCTV setup.

No new hardware, no manual tagging — just a live feed that tells you *which car came in, when it left,* and *how long it stayed.*

Once the data is in, **AIDeal** steps in. It connects the dots between vehicle movement, service jobs, and business outcomes. The result? Predictive analytics and dashboards that let you see — at a glance — where your workshop flow slows down.

## Real-Time Visibility = Faster Turnaround

One dealership recently implemented both tools to track the **24-hour turnaround** goal for their service vehicles.  
Here’s what happened:

- **Automatic in-and-out detection** replaced manual bay logs.  
- **Supervisors received daily email alerts** showing vehicles pending beyond 24 hours.  
- **Managers gained live visibility** into completed-but-not-delivered cars.  

The impact was immediate:  
✅ Same-day turnaround jumped from **40–60% to 70–90%**.  
✅ Service **capacity increased by 10%**, without adding staff or bays.  
✅ Customer satisfaction improved as delivery promises were consistently met.  

All from simply *seeing what was really happening.*

## Why Observability Matters

In every service center, the real challenge isn’t just fixing cars — it’s managing time.  
Bays jam up not because of technical faults, but due to *waiting:* for approval, for payment, for a technician or cashier.

When every delay is timestamped and visible, accountability and action naturally follow.  
That’s the power of **AI observability** — it doesn’t just report data; it changes behavior.

## The Best Part: No Complex Setup

Both **Platemate AI** and **AIDeal** are designed to fit into your existing environment:  
- Works with standard CCTV cameras.  
- Deploys quickly on-premise or cloud.  
- Sends automated reports and alerts by email.  

It’s the easiest way to turn your existing systems into a 24x7 operations assistant.

## Conclusion

Every dealership already has the data to run more efficiently — it’s just trapped in video footage and manual logs.  
By unlocking it, AI gives service centers a new kind of visibility: one that helps them move faster, serve better, and grow capacity without expansion.

**Your cameras already see everything. Now it’s time for your business to see it too.**
