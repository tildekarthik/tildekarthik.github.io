In a busy dealership, it’s rarely the big problems that slow things down.  
It’s the small, silent ones — a delayed billing, an electrician tied up, a vehicle waiting for approval.

Individually, they seem minor. But together, they create the familiar picture of full bays, idle technicians, and missed delivery targets.

The good news? Those issues can be caught early — with **real-time AI alerts**.

## The Power of Instant Awareness

When a vehicle crosses the **24-hour threshold**, or when completed cars remain on-site too long, a simple **email alert** from **AIDeal** and **Platemate AI** can make all the difference.

That single notification triggers immediate action:  
- The cashier checks pending bills.  
- The supervisor reallocates a bay.  
- The service advisor calls the customer for pickup.  

No escalation meetings. No digging through spreadsheets.  
Just quiet, continuous course correction — guided by live data.

## How the Alerts Work

1. **Platemate AI** detects every vehicle’s in/out automatically from CCTV feeds.  
2. **AIDeal** maps this data to job cards, timestamps, and status updates.  
3. When a vehicle exceeds the 24-hour mark or other custom thresholds,  
   an **automated email alert** goes out to relevant team members.

Each alert contains:
- Vehicle number and image  
- Duration of stay  
- Department involved  
- Simple call-to-action (“Ready but undelivered”, “Awaiting billing”, etc.)

It’s AI working quietly in the background — a digital assistant that never sleeps.

## Why Small Fixes Matter

The difference between a 60% and 90% same-day delivery rate isn’t huge process overhauls.  
It’s early intervention.

> “Before, we discovered delays only when customers asked.  
> Now, we know before they do.” — *Workshop Supervisor*

Each alert prevents a small problem from turning into a larger backlog.  
And over weeks, these micro-improvements compound into measurable capacity gains — often **10% or more**.
