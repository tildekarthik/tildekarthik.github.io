      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Vispect, we know real feedback from users is invaluable. Here’s the genuine, unedited voice of a plant quality head who implemented the Vispect AI visual inspection system in their factory:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Most important benefit Sir, No need for trained operator. New boy joined, in 3rd day he was doing inspection of assembly with more than 60 brackets. Big benefit.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We have other states contractors working, they said computer wont be better than us, why you want to use computer. 3 months ago I showed him(a senior contractor) the one failure that went to customer and we fixed it there, then I showed him that system had pointed it too! – Now he will not move to paint shop without AI inspection.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
